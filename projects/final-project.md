<h1>Campus Careers Overview</h1>

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/">

<h3>Overview</h3>
Our team shared the issue that friendships tended to be concentrated within one’s own academic department. The root cause of this was that most opportunities to interact at school came through classes, and even extracurricular events were typically related to the student’s department. So, the solution we aimed for was to create a “space” where people could engage with a broader range of individuals. The <b>Campus Careers</b> project was launched to enable the formation of cross-departmental friendships through a chat application featuring high-randomness matching.

<h3>Features</h3>
Campus Careers includes the following features:
- Homepage
- Profile editing page
- Admin Dashboard page
- Filter skill or location page
- Matching skill and location page
URL: https://campus-careers-app.vercel.app/

<h3>My Role</h3>
I was in charge of the filter browsing skill/location page and admin dashboard page. By using Nextjs and Typescript functions, I implemented the admin dashboard page. I was also involved in UI development. I implemented the database and deploy vercel. To do this, I also developed the necessary APIs and designed the database, fundmentally improving the system.

<h3>Community Feedback</h3>

Allowing admin to edit user's profile and matching the companies with their preference of skill and location.
