At first, ESLint felt like my coding teacher, always pointing out my mistakes and demanding perfection for my code even I write a simple function, and suddenly my screen was littered with red squiggles, warnings, and errors. It was overwhelming. Some of the errors seemed unnecessary and like enforcing a specific indentation style, while others were genuinely helpful, catching potential bugs I would have overlooked.

<h3>The Pain and Gain of Fixing Errors</h3>
There's no sugarcoating it—fixing all ESLint errors can be tedious, especially when first getting used to the rules. Some errors required small adjustments, like adding semicolons or fixing indentation, while others forced me to rethink my logic or restructure parts of my code. The process sometimes felt like an uphill battle, but I found that as I adjusted my habits, the number of errors decreased, and writing clean code became more natural. The true value of ESLint became apparent when I revisited some older code that I wrote without it. The inconsistencies and minor issues stood out immediately, and I realized how much cleaner and more readable my ESLint-enforced code had become. What once seemed like a burden was actually making me a better developer.

<h3>Why Coding Standards Matter As A Developer</h3>
As I worked through the issues, I began to appreciate what ESLint was doing. It wasn't just enforcing a standard, a discipline in my coding. It pushed me to be more consistent, think more critically about my syntax, and avoid bad practices that could lead to bigger issues down the road. Beyond just fixing errors, ESLint enforces coding standards—rules that ensure uniformity and best practices across projects. These standards aren't just for myself, but it's also for the teams working on large-scale projects. When everyone follows the same conventions, collaboration becomes smoother, debugging is easier, and code reviews are more efficient. While getting rid of all error can be painful at the first time, it is also incredibly useful. ESLint forces developers to be mindful of best practices, ensure cleaner code, and ultimately make projects more easy to maintainable. Becasue of that, I would want to code using ESLint, so it  could shaping me into more disciplined and efficient developer.

In the end, coding standards, whether enforced by ESLint or another tool, are not just about writing code that works—they're about writing code that lasts. And that, in the long run, is what truly matters.
