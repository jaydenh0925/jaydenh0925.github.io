Effort estimation and tracking are critical components of any software development process, even if the results are often far from perfect. In my recent software engineering project, I experienced firsthand how challenging accurate effort estimation can be, but also how valuable the practice is, even when the numbers don’t always match reality.

<h2>How I Made My Effort Estimates</h2>
At the start of each sprint or issue assignment, I made my effort estimates based on a mix of intuition, past experience, and a rough breakdown of subtasks. For example, if an issue involved setting up authentication, I would list out the steps—designing the auth flow, setting up the database, integrating the front end, testing, and documentation. Then I’d assign estimated hours to each component, usually erring on the side of optimism. I often relied on “gut feel” more than formal methods, especially in areas where I lacked previous experience.

<h2>Benefits of Making Estimates—Even If They Were Off</h2>
Even though my estimates were sometimes significantly off, there were clear benefits to making them. First, estimating forced me to think critically about the scope of the task. I had to mentally simulate how I would solve the problem, which helped identify hidden complexities early on. This process naturally improved task clarity. Second, effort estimates supported planning and prioritization. Even inaccurate estimates gave a rough sense of workload distribution, which helped in team coordination and avoiding overcommitment.

<h2>Benefits of Tracking Actual Effort</h2>
Tracking the actual effort expended was even more valuable. By logging the hours I spent on each issue, I started to see patterns in my workflow—such as how long debugging usually took or how easily I underestimated integration tasks. This data helped refine future estimates and encouraged me to reflect on inefficiencies. Additionally, having an accurate record of effort supported retrospectives and made it easier to communicate progress to others, including team members and instructors.

<h2>Downsides of Estimating and Tracking</h2>
The only significant downside was the slight mental overhead involved. Estimating effort before starting and remembering to log time afterward added a bit of friction. However, this overhead was minor and did not meaningfully inhibit progress. The greater challenge was psychological: it was sometimes demotivating to see how far off my estimates were, especially when I had underestimated something by several hours. But this discomfort also pushed me to improve.

<h2>My Tracking Method and Its Accuracy</h2>
I tracked my effort manually using a combination of time-blocking on my calendar and a Notion table where I logged the issue, estimated time, and actual time spent. While this method wasn’t perfectly precise—especially for multitasking sessions or late-night coding—it was close enough to be meaningful. I’d estimate my tracking was about 80–90% accurate, with most discrepancies due to context-switching or forgetting to record short working sessions.

<h2>Overhead of Tracking</h2>
In terms of time cost, tracking effort probably consumed no more than 5–10 minutes per day. Once I built the habit, it became routine. It never inhibited my ability to work or caused frustration. If anything, it created a brief pause for reflection at the end of each session, which helped me stay aware of how I was spending my time.

While my effort estimates were often off, the practice of estimating and tracking effort was far from a waste. These activities promoted awareness, accountability, and continuous improvement. They provided a structure for reflection, which is just as important as writing code. If I were to repeat the project—or take on a more complex one—I would continue using these techniques, perhaps with refinements like automated time tracking or more collaborative estimation sessions. In software engineering, estimation isn’t about perfection—it’s about learning and planning better over time.
