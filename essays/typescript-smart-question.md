## Asking a SMART Questions 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12827266/get-and-set-in-typescript">Link to SMART Stackoverflow question</a>

In my opinion, TypeScript uses the getter/setter syntax similarly to ECMAScript 4 and ActionScript 3. However, to use it properly, the TypeScript compiler must target ECMAScript 5 or higher. The get method allows reading a property's value. It is declared using the get keyword, followed by a method name. The method should return the value of a private or protected property. To define a set method, which allows modifying a property's value, we use the set keyword, followed by a method name. The set method usually includes validation logic before assigning a new value to ensure data integrity. In this example, the original poster asked a well-structured and smart question. They provided a clear code example and precisely pointed to the information they needed. The person who answered the question also explained how to use get and set clearly. Furthermore, they provided an additional example using ECMAScript 5 with the <b>Object.defineProperty()</b> feature, making it easier for others to understand the concept.

## Asking a Stupid Questions

Based on my experience, this question is not a SMART question. The original poster did not clearly define the title, making it difficult for others to understand the issue. Additionally, they did not provide any example code or context to assist those who might want to help. Instead, the post simply stated that "this simple code part isn't working for me at all" without giving any clues about the problem they encountered. Such vague questions are not considered SMART because they do not provide enough context for others to offer meaningful assistance.

## SMART question will be better

Asking SMART questions makes problem-solving more efficient. For example, when doctors diagnose patients, they ask precise questions to gather the necessary information for proper treatment. The same principle applies to software development. When debugging or collaborating on an issue, asking well-structured questions, as suggested by Raymond in his essay, leads to smarter and more effective responses. It is essential to be courteous by making the question as clear and concise as possible. One key point Raymond emphasizes is that "Grovelling is not a substitute for doing your homework," which is absolutely true. Instead of simply stating a lack of knowledge on the subject, it is more beneficial—and time-efficient—for both parties if the questioner does some preliminary research before asking for help.

## Bring It All Together

In summary, both well-structured (SMART) and poorly formulated questions exist. The difference lies in how much effort and information the questioner provides to the community. SMART questions typically include sufficient background information while maintaining brevity, allowing the community to quickly understand and provide high-quality answers. On the other hand, poorly formulated questions often present a problem without any attempted solutions or prior knowledge, making it harder for others to assist. Raymond's guidelines offer valuable insights into crafting better questions, particularly in online forums where most of these issues arise. Ultimately, it all comes down to the effort people put into solving their own problems before seeking help.
