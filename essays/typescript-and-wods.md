* A thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

Unlike JavaScript that I have learned before, TypeScript is statically typed, allowing myself to define the variable types explicitly. Compared to JavaScript, TypeScript is more readable and easier to maintain than JavaScript.

## TypeScript, Balance of Structure and Flexibility

From my experience, TypeScript offers more benefit compared to JavaScript and Java. It significantly reduces runtime errors, improves readability, and provide enhanced tooling support including autocompletion and errors checking. One of the key features of TypeScript is it requires explicit variable type. I got lot of confusion at the first-time using TypeScript, but once I became familiar with it, I realized how much easier to work with JavaScript and it feels like the enhanced version of JavaScript, combining its flexibility with added structure and safety.

## WODs just like quizzes, the power of practicing

WODs are similar like quizzes, but it demands more practice than just learning concepts. I see WODs as Workout of the Day exercise, an exercise that pushes us to complete the assignments before the set time. It encourages us to think critically and code efficiently under pressure. This is a good chance to improve our code.

## Bring It All Together

The combination of TypeScript & WODs that emphasize both precision and efficiency. TypeScript shows the developer to write a clean, structure code, reducing bugs and enhancing maintainability. Meanwhile, WODs encourage us to practice more after learning the concepts, solving the problem rapidly within the set time. It pushes developers apply their knowledge in real-time scenarios with a deadline.

To me, TypeScript may not be ideal for small projects or beginners without a solid JavaScript foundation. It requires a lot of practicing and learning concepts. Likewise, WODs intensity may not suit for lazy person who prefer a slower practice. However, for those who are willing to embrace challenges, both have tremendous potential for growth as a software engineer.

## Conclusion

TypeScript and WODs, together create a powerful framework for learning and growth. The more we learn concepts and practice under pressure, the more skill and insight are gained. For anyone seeking to improve their craft as a software engineer, exploring these tools and methodologies is an investment that will pay dividends for years to come.
