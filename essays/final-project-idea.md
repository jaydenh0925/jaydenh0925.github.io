<h2 style="Color:#A47864">Overview</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
Many UH Mānoa students live off-campus and rely on buses, bikes, or carpools to get to and from school. However, there's no easy way to connect students who live nearby and want to share rides or biking routes. This application leads to students either commuting alone, paying more than necessary for gas or rideshares, or simply struggling to figure out the best commuting options.

<h3>The Solution</h3>
Mānoa Green Ride application: a sustainable student-focused ride-share and route-sharing web app built specifically for UH Mānoa commuters.

Mānoa Green Ride allows students to:
- Log in and create a commute profile (location, school's schedule, preferences).
- Find carpool partners or biking buddies based on their information.
- Post or join ride-share offers.
- Mark themselves as available/unavailable for a given week.

<h2 style="Color:#A47864">Mockup Idea</h2>
- **Landing Page**: Welcome message and CTA to log in or register.
- **Dashboard**: Personalized commute suggestions, route matches, and weekly schedule.
- **Ride Board**: Post a ride or request a ride with options for one-time or weekly commutes.
- **Profile Page**: Commute preferences, schedule, and history.
- **Admin Tools**: Tools for managing flagged posts, inappropriate content, or account issues.

<h2 style="Color:#A47864">Use Case Idea</h2>
- A student signs up, log in, enters their weekly schedule and address, and is matched with others in their neighborhood who also drive to UH Mānoa.
- A student without a car sees the best bus routes and gets a text notification if a fellow student nearby is offering a ride.
- Two users connect based on their information.
- Admin goes to landing pages, log in, edit students information

<h2 style="Color:#A47864">Beyond the basics</h2>
After implementing the basic functionally, here are some ideas for more advance features.
- Connect with Manoa's database to check if the student information is correct or not.
- Real-time traffic and bus schedule data using public APIs.
- Chat feature for users to coordinate rides.
- Tracker based on commute method.
- Notification for ride match alerts or schedule changes.
